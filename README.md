# FYP-PC-Child-Timer
Final Year Project This version of the code only works in an executable Jar file form with how the file system is setup. Please do not execute this version in an IDE unless the file system set up correctly. The file path for the password should be "../Finished Timer/src/pass/Password.txt" to avoid errors.
