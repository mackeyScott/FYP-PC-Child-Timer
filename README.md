# FYP-PC-Child-Timer
Final Year Project This version of the code only works in an executable Jar file form with how the file system is setup. 
Please do not execute this version in an IDE unless the file system set up correctly. 

The file path for the password should be "../Finished Timer/src/pass/Password.txt" to avoid errors. For the default set password, go to the Help menu and click on the "about" section for this information.

To launch the program extract the zipped folder from github and then run the "Launcher.vbs" file which will run the application.
The code files have been included in the folder so you can load them into an IDE and view the code.

"Lock.bat" locks the workstation when executed.
"protoBat.bat" is the file the launcher runs launching it threw vbs allows for the command line window to not show up.
